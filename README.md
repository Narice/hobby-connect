# HobbyConnect

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Usage of this application

This application has four screens:
- the home screen
- the login screen
- the theme selection screen
- and finally the daily activity screen

The current workflow is this one:
the user arrives at the home page.
He then logs in to the website by using (for now) his id (use 1 for testing for example).
Then the user chooses his themes of preferences.
Then the user arrives at the activities screen.

The activities screen for now has only one activity. This is not a limitation of the screen but a limitation of the backend for now.

The activities are generated every day at midnight.
Activities are generated based on the themes the user has selected.
